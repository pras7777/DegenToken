# DegenToken

### Overview
The `DegenToken` smart contract is designed to manage a custom ERC20 token named "Degen" (DGN). It provides functionalities for minting, transferring, redeeming, burning tokens, and creating game items associated with token ownership.

### Smart Contract Structure
- **ERC20 Standard**: Inherits from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract to implement the standard ERC20 token interface.
- **State Variables**:
  - `owner`: Immutable address representing the owner of the contract.
  - `itemId`: Counter for tracking game item IDs.
- **Structs**:
  - `GameItemsInfo`: Represents information about a game item, including owner address, name, and amount.
- **Mappings**:
  - `IdToGameItemsInfo`: Maps item IDs to their respective information.
- **Custom Errors**:
  - `NotOwner`: Indicates that the sender is not the owner of the contract.
  - `InsufficientBalance`: Indicates insufficient balance for burning tokens.
  - `ItemNotFound`: Indicates that the specified game item ID does not exist.
- **Modifiers**:
  - `onlyOwner`: Restricts certain functions to be called only by the owner of the contract.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the contract with the token name, symbol, and mints initial tokens to the contract itself.
- **Functions**:
  - `mint`: Allows the owner to mint new tokens and distribute them to specified addresses.
  - `transfer`: Overrides the ERC20 `transfer` function to include a check for the sender's balance before transferring tokens.
  - `redeemToken`: Enables users to redeem tokens associated with specific game items.
  - `balanceOf`: Retrieves the token balance of a specified account.
  - `burn`: Allows token holders to burn a specific amount of their tokens.
  - `createGameItems`: Allows the owner to create new game items associated with token ownership.

### Usage
1. **Deployment**: Deploy the `DegenToken` contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Interacting with the Contract**: Users can interact with the contract through various functions:
   - Mint new tokens (accessible only to the owner).
   - Transfer tokens to other addresses.
   - Redeem tokens for specific game items.
   - Check token balance.
   - Burn tokens.
   - Create new game items associated with token ownership.
   
### Testing
- Ensure to test all functionalities thoroughly before deploying the contract in a production environment.
- Test different scenarios, including minting, transferring, redeeming, and burning tokens, to ensure proper functionality and error handling.

### Dependencies
- This contract utilizes the OpenZeppelin library for the ERC20 implementation.
